# first, a few generalities about the server:

# The maximum number of users.
# In most cases, the internet uplink is the limiting factor; count on about
# 100 kbit/s per user, depending on the compression level you choose.
maxusers 10

# On which port should the server listen?
# An obvious choice would be 80, so users don't need to specify it in the URL.
# However, this requires the websdr binary to be setuid root, see install.txt.
# A common alternative choice is 8901.
tcpport 8080

# If your computer is on a 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x network on which there

# It enables the system administration interface in sysop.html also for computers
# on these local networks.

# Set a timeout of x seconds for idle users (i.e., users who don't
# change the frequency etc. for x seconds are disconnected).
# Can be useful if your site is popular and has limited internet
# bandwidth.
